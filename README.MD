# Project 1

You should write a Stopwatch component.

The functionality should be in one class, the class should have `render()` method, so it can be understood by the `Renderer` class.

## The Requirements:

- If you use your CSS Skills for animations and transitions is a plus!

- If you use a beautiful design, is another plus!

- You can use jQuery library.

- All the information should be stored in the class, not a global object.

- The Stopwatch should have `start()`, `pause()` and `reset()` methods.

- The Stopwatch `render()` method should not modify the HTML by itself, it should only return a single DOM Element.

- The Stopwatch should display Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Milliseconds.

- The `render()` method should not use or contain any ID attribute.
